# siCode
This directory aims to solve the following three tasks:

* Clustering numeric features extracted from both daytime and nighttime remote sensing data;
- More information concerning the process of feature extraction can be found at https://github.com/Haoyu6iu/GDP-Estimation

* Constructing a directed graph of clusters under the guidance of nightlight;
* Scoring images as well as the corresponding areas covered by them via CNNs;

The file siSpear.ipynb is applied to examine the validity of development indices calculated by this method.

Codes in this repository are mainly for fine-grained socioeconomic development index in China. If you prefer to use them on a different task, moderate changes are recommended.
